# IDATT2503 Exercise 04 Task 03



I was unable to produce any noticeable result from Task 3, except for correcting the typo in `another_function`. The original code:

``` c
void another_function() {
  printf("You have caled another_function\n");
}
```

was corrected to:

```c
void another_function() {
  printf("You have called another_function\n");
}
```



After collaborating with others, we came to the conclusion that the "result" we were supposed to find was that we could bypass changes to the main program's binary simply by altering the dynamic library binary. This would make for an effective attack surface, where one would have a backdoor of sorts into the source code, being able to change the program behavior without actually changing the source code itself, and without even recompiling it.

Even if I didn't accomplish the exploit itself, the realization that this is (if I got the result right) a possible attack vector very interesting!
